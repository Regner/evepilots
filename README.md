evepilots
=========
Designed as a replacment/update to EVE Who with added features from Dotlan. Both
services offer great products but Dotlan is designed primarily as a mapping
service and EVE Who is lacking a lot of features that evepilots tries to add.

The primary goal of evepilots is to offer a one stop service for looking up
information (except kills, zKillbaord covers that well enough) on capsuleers,
corporations, and alliances.

Features evepilots tries to add ontop of the basic information that EVE Who
offers is graphs of security status for capsuleers, graphs of member counts for
corporations and alliances, and more.

This application is in the early stages of development and not ready for public
use yet.
